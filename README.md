# HW-AI
### Forecasting heatwaves with AI

### Overview
A Python code for making AI-based sub-seasonal forecasts of summer heatwaves in central Europe. The machine learning models used are linear and random forest models, both for regression and classification tasks. This code reproduces the data and experiments presented in:

E. Weirich Benet, M. Pyrina, B. Jim√©nez Esteve, E. Fraenkel, J. Cohen, and D. I. V. Domeisen, "*publication year*": Sub-seasonal Prediction of Central European Summer Heatwaves with Linear and Random Forest Machine Learning Models, AIES, AMS, "*issue number, page range*", DOI: "*XYZ*".

### Dependencies 
The code was developed using Python 3.7.10 and several external libraries, which were installed with conda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/): 
xarray
pandas
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
sklearn

### Input data 
"*List the data sources and years. Refer to table in paper.*"

### Code structure
"*Describe the content of the different .py files, how they are linked to each other, in which order to run them etc.*"
