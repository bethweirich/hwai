# HWAI
### Heatwave forecasting with Artificial Intelligence

### Overview
A Python code for making AI-based sub-seasonal forecasts of summer heatwaves in central Europe. The machine learning models used are linear and random forest models, both for regression and classification tasks. This code reproduces the data and experiments presented in the pre-print: E. Weirich Benet, M. Pyrina, B. Jim√©nez Esteve, E. Fraenkel, J. Cohen, and D. I. V. Domeisen: *Sub-seasonal Prediction of Central European Summer Heatwaves with Linear and Random Forest Machine Learning Models*, EarthArXiv, DOI: https://doi.org/10.31223/X5663G [1]

### Dependencies 
The code was developed using Python 3.7.10 and several external libraries, which were installed with conda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/): <br/> 
xarray 0.16.1 <br/> 
pandas 1.1.3 <br/>
numpy 1.20.2 <br/>
scipy 1.5.3 <br/>
sklearn (or scikit-learn) 0.24.1 <br/>
imblearn (or imbalanced-learn) 0.8.0 <br/>
matplotlib 3.4.1 <br/>
seaborn 0.11.1 <br/>
eofs 1.4.0 <br/>

In addition, the TIGRAMITE toolbox by J. Runge (https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite) is used for data visualization purposes. You only need to import it to run the *data_visualization.py* script.  

### Input data 
The sources of the input data are listed in Table 1 in [1]. The raw data is not provided in this GitHub repository due to their large size. The pre-processed data (output from *preprocessing_part1.py*) is provided additionally in the *data* folder.

### Code structure
The code is split up into ten inter-connected Python scripts, located in the *python_scripts* folder: <br/>
1. *const.py* defines a dictionary that contains all user-selected settings and constants. You can define the folders where you want to save the output data, plots, and tables here.
2. Run *preprocessing_part1.py* to preprocess the raw data (files not provided) in time and space. Its output is a dataset containing the time series of the predictors and targets, which is saved to a local file and provided here under *data/XXX*. 
3. Run *data_visualization.py* to visualize some characteristics of the output of *preprocessing_part1.py* (e.g., the lagged correlations between the predictors and the target and the class imbalance of the heat wave indices).
4. Run *executer.py* to obtain the final prediction in form of plots and tables, which are displayed and saved to your chosen folder. This scripts takes the output of *preprocessing_part1.py* as its input.
5. The six remaining scripts (*preprocessing_part2.py*, *prediction.py*, *reference_forecasts.py*, *metrics.py*, *plotting.py*, and *utils.py*) contain only function definitions. These functions are called by the scripts in 1-4. Running any of these six scripts on its own does not produce any output.
  5a) *preprocessing_part2.py* contains all data preprocessing steps that must be run after the prediction lead time is fixed (e.g., creating a dataset of lagged predictors or balancing out the binary heatwave indices).
  5b) *prediction.py* contains the machine learning algorithms' training, validation and testing steps. It also calls the functions in *preprocessing_part2.py* in order. 
  5c) *reference_forecasts.py* computes three reference forecasts which are used as a baseline to assess the predictive power of the machine learning algorithms: persistence, climatology, and the ECMWF forecast. 
  5d) *metrics.py* contains all functions related to the evaluation of the machine learning and reference forecasts, compared to the ground truth. For regression, RMSE and Pearson correlation are calculated. Similarly, ROC AUC and the geometric mean of the TPR and FPR are calculated for classification.
  5e) *plotting.py* is used to plot all figures that appear in the paper [1].
  5f) *utils.py* is a toolbox containing short functions. 
  
 ### Sample runs
 The outputs from *executer.py* used for the main results (*sample_run-noCV.pdf*) and the nested cross-validation results shown in the Appendix (*sample_run-nestedCV.pdf*) are in the *sample_runs* folder. Due to their large size (about 35MB), they cannot be visualized on GitHub and must be downloaded.
